        <h2>Half Girlfriend</h2>
        <img src="./images/half gf.jfif" alt="Image">
        <h3>Author's Name-Chetan Bhagat</h3>
        <p>Chetan Bhagat commented, "Half-Girlfriend, to me, is a unique Indian phenomenon where boys and girls are not
            clear about their relationship status with each other. A boy may think he is more than friends with the
            girl, but the girl is still not his girlfriend. Hence, I thought we needed a term like "half girlfriend".
